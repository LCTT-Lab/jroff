## Usage

(**TODO**)

## Contributing

For regular development, you need to have `Node.js >=0.10` installed on
your system, then:

Clone the repository

```console
git clone git@bitbucket.org:roperzh/jroff_final.git
cd jroff_final
```

Install the required dependencies

```console
npm install
```

Build your local copy and run the tests:

```console
make all
```

### Brief explanation of the code organization

`dist`: This folder stores the bundled versions of the code.

`src/core`: As the folder name says, this is the core of the library.
There is no HTML-related code here, only code to parse and build the AST.

`src/generators`: Generators are entities capables of consume the AST
generated by the parser and produce an output. For the moment only an HTML
generator is implemented.

`src/macros`: Implementations of macro commands divided in macro packages.
For the moment only `an` and `doc` packages are supported.
Macros supported by groff are stored in `default.js`.

`src/utils`: Utility functions and stuff.

### Brief explanation of useful make commands

***make dist:*** beautify and build both minified and concatenated versions
of the code.

***make hint:*** run [js-hint](http://jshint.com/) over the test files
and the concatenated non-minified version of the code.

***make beautify:*** run [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)
over all the JavaScript files.

***make doc:*** build a local documentation based on the current version
of the code, useful to preview the documentation before pushing.
Check the next section for more details.

### Documenting new code

This library uses [jsdoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) to generate
the documentation, so all the new code must be documented using jsdoc
tags. An useful reference can be found [here](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html).

Also, due to [limitations](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/issues/930) with
jsdoc and UMD it is required to add the `@alias` tag to all functions,
constructors and namespaces.

### Generating the documentation

The Makefile includes an useful command to generate and push the
documentation to GitHub and GitHub pages, you can simply run:

```console
make doc-build
```

**Note:** please make sure to stash or commit all your changes
before building the documentation.

If you want to preview the changes before pushing, you can generate
the documentation with the `doc` task and then and open `docs/index.html`
in your browser.

This is an example using OS X:

```console
make doc
open docs/index.html
```
